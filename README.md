# ITSECWB-Project
ITSECWB Project (Originated from CCAPDEV MCO2 Open Forum Project)

Currently,

- Has it's own in-memory system so the database is up and running while the program is running pero it refreshes the data upon restarting of the program (Doesn't have integration to MongoDB/MongoDB Atlas) 
- Only works on Client-side (localhost)
